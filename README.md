# Caveboy
*Parallelized Video Sequence Recognition*

## What is this?

Caveboy is a rather *naive* but working implementation of a multilayer perceptron specialized into video processing.
It can be *trained* to memorize several video sequences and then use it to "watch" a much longer video and detect it.

## How does it work?

It slices videos in separated individual frames in `png` format which will be read and used it as patterns to recognize.
The frame slicing allows different machines to compute different video sections in parallel.
